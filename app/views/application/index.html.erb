  <h1>Never forget your tasks again!</h1>

  <p>
    If you're like me, besides being a very nice guy, you always forget your
    tasks (or just use this excuse to your wife). But don't fear anymore,
    all your problems are not solved (life is hard), but at least this one is.
  </p>

  <p>
    With 2 Post It you can manage your tasks adding them as post its. So, when you sign in,
    you see all your unfinished tasks, and when you finish one of them, you just mark it,
    and that task disappear. So, it's time to think another excuse to your wife.
